- implement forward deletion (with delete-> key)
- also reprint what's after when forward deleting
- be careful to keep the cursor coherent (maybe check out with termios)
- make it possible to move past the first character (it's impossible for now
  because there is no element in the list before the first, so it just
  does not do it, maybe create an exception or a head for the list)
