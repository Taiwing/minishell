- fix backspace on tab: tab has a variable length which I don't know at the
  moment I am erasing it from the buffer, so the output doesnt match the ddlst
  content.
- reprint what is after the backspace with 1 space after it to erase the last
  character of the line (more than 1 space must be printed if a tab is printed)
- implement forward deletion (with delete-> key)
- also reprint what's after when forward deleting
- reprint when inserting in the middle of the input (if *lst && (*lst)->next)
- be careful to keep the cursor coherent (maybe check out with termios)
- make it possible to erase the first character (it's impossible for now
  because there is no element in the list before the first, so it just
  does not do it, maybe create an execption or a head for the list)
